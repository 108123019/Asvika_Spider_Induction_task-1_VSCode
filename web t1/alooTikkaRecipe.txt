Prepare Potatoes: Boil the potatoes until they are fork-tender. Peel the potatoes and mash them well in a large mixing bowl.

Add Ingredients: To the mashed potatoes, add grated paneer (if using), bread crumbs or roasted gram flour, chopped coriander leaves, green chilies, ginger paste, garlic paste, garam masala powder, chaat masala, turmeric powder, red chili powder, salt, lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons of oil.

Mix Well: Mix all the ingredients thoroughly until well combined and the mixture comes together like a dough.

Shape into Tikka: Take small portions of the mixture and shape them into small, round or oval-shaped tikkas. You can also insert skewers or toothpicks into each tikka for easier grilling or baking.

Grill or Bake:

Grilling: Preheat your grill or grill pan. Brush the tikkas with a little oil and place them on the grill. Cook each side until golden brown and crispy, turning occasionally to cook evenly.
Baking: Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F). Place the tikkas on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush them with oil. Bake for about 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until they are golden and crispy.
Serve:

Remove the tikkas from the skewers or toothpicks if used.
Sprinkle with chaat masala and garnish with lemon wedges, onion rings, and fresh coriander leaves.
Serve hot Aloo Tikka as an appetizer or snack with mint chutney or tamarind chutney.
