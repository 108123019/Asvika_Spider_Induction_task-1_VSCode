Prepare Baby Corn: Rinse the baby corn well under running water. Pat them dry with a kitchen towel. Cut them into bite-sized pieces.

Make Dry Masala Mix: In a bowl, mix corn flour, rice flour (or all-purpose flour), red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder, and salt. Adjust the spice levels according to your taste.

Coat Baby Corn: Sprinkle the dry masala mix over the baby corn pieces and toss them well until each piece is coated evenly with the flour mixture. Set aside for 10-15 minutes to marinate.

Prepare Batter: In another bowl, prepare the batter by mixing corn flour, rice flour (or all-purpose flour), a pinch of baking soda (if using), salt, and enough water to make a thick batter that coats the back of a spoon.

Coat in Batter: Heat oil for deep frying in a pan or kadai over medium-high heat. Dip each marinated baby corn piece into the batter, ensuring it is well coated.

Fry Baby Corn: Carefully drop the coated baby corn pieces into the hot oil. Fry in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry until they turn golden brown and crispy. Remove from oil using a slotted spoon and drain excess oil on paper towels.

Serve: Serve hot baby corn fry as a snack or appetizer. You can garnish with chopped coriander leaves or sprinkle some chaat masala on top for extra flavor.

Enjoy your crispy and flavorful baby corn fry!
