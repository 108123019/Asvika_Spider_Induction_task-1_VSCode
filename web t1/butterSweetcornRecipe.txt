Prepare Corn Kernels:

If using fresh corn, boil or steam the corn kernels until tender. If using frozen corn, thaw them by rinsing under cold water.
Sautéing:

Heat butter in a pan or skillet over medium heat.
Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.
Add finely chopped onion and green chilies (if using). Sauté until onions turn translucent.
Add Corn and Spices:

Add the boiled or thawed corn kernels to the pan.
Sprinkle red chili powder, garam masala powder, salt, and freshly ground black pepper over the corn. Mix well to coat the corn with the spices.
Cooking:

Cook the corn for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it is heated through and well coated with the butter and spices.
Garnish and Serve:

Garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves, if using.
Serve hot butter sweetcorn as a side dish or snack. Optionally, serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over the corn for added zest.
