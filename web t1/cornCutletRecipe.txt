Firstly, in a mixer jar take 1 cup sweet corn, pulse, and grind to coarse texture.
Transfer the coarse sweet corn into a large bowl.
Add 2 tbsp carrot, 2 tbsp capsicum, ½ onion, 2 tbsp coriander.
Also add ¼ tsp turmeric, ½ tsp chilli powder, ½ tsp coriander powder, ½ tsp cumin powder, and ½ tsp salt.
Now add 2 potato and mix well making sure all the spices are well combined.
Further, add ¼ cup bread crumbs and 2 tbsp corn flour.
Mix well forming a soft dough. corn flour helps to make cutlet crispy and bread crumbs absorbs excess moisture and prevents from breaking in oil while frying.
Grease hands with oil, and shape the cutlet.
Deep fry in hot oil, keeping the flame on medium.
Stir occasionally, until the cutlet turns golden brown and crispy.
Drain off the cutlet over a kitchen towel to remove excess oil.
Finally, enjoy crispy corn cutlet recipe with tomato sauce.
