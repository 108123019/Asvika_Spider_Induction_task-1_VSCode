Prepare Corn Kernels:

If using fresh corn, boil or steam the corn kernels until tender. If using frozen corn, thaw them by rinsing under cold water.
Coat Corn Kernels:

In a bowl, mix corn flour, rice flour (or all-purpose flour), red chili powder, garam masala powder, and salt.
Add the boiled or thawed corn kernels to the flour mixture. Toss well to coat the corn kernels evenly with the flour mixture.
Fry Crispy Corn:

Heat oil for deep frying in a pan or kadai over medium-high heat.
Carefully drop the coated corn kernels into the hot oil.
Fry in batches until they turn golden brown and crispy.
Remove from oil using a slotted spoon and drain excess oil on paper towels. Set aside.
Make the Sauce:

Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat.
Add finely chopped garlic, ginger, and green chilies. Saut√© for a minute until aromatic.
Add Vegetables:

Add finely chopped onion and thinly sliced bell pepper (capsicum). Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until the vegetables are slightly tender yet crisp.
Prepare the Sauce:

Add tomato ketchup, soy sauce, chili sauce, vinegar or lemon juice, sugar, and salt to taste. Mix well.
Thicken the Sauce:

Pour in 1/2 cup of water and bring the mixture to a simmer.
In a small bowl, mix 1 tablespoon of corn flour with 2 tablespoons of water to make a slurry. Gradually add the corn flour slurry to the simmering sauce, stirring continuously until the sauce thickens to a gravy consistency.
Combine Crispy Corn and Sauce:

Once the sauce thickens, add the fried crispy corn kernels to the wok or skillet. Toss well until the corn kernels are well coated with the sauce.
Finish and Serve:

Garnish with chopped spring onions.
Serve hot crispy corn as a delicious appetizer or snack.
