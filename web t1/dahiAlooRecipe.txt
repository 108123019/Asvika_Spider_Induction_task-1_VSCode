Prepare Potatoes:

Boil the potatoes until they are fork-tender. Peel and cube them into bite-sized pieces. Set aside.
Whisk Yogurt:

In a bowl, whisk the yogurt until smooth and creamy. Set aside.
Prepare Spice Mix:

In a small bowl, mix turmeric powder, coriander powder, red chili powder, and garam masala powder with 2-3 tablespoons of water to make a smooth paste. This prevents the spices from burning when added to the hot oil.
Cook Dahi Aloo:

Heat oil or ghee in a pan or kadai over medium heat.
Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.
Add slit green chilies, ginger paste, and garlic paste. Saut√© for a minute until fragrant.
Add Spice Paste:

Lower the heat and carefully add the spice paste mixture to the pan. Stir well and cook for 1-2 minutes until the raw smell of the spices goes away and oil starts to separate from the mixture.
Add Potatoes:

Add the boiled and cubed potatoes to the pan. Stir gently to coat the potatoes with the spice mixture.
Add Yogurt:

Gradually add the whisked yogurt to the pan, stirring continuously to combine well with the potatoes and spices.
Simmer:

Add salt to taste and adjust the consistency of the gravy by adding water as needed. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer.
Cook Until Done:

Cover the pan and let the Dahi Aloo simmer on low heat for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are well coated with the creamy yogurt gravy and the flavors have melded together.
Garnish and Serve:

Garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves.
Serve hot Dahi Aloo with steamed rice, roti, or naan.
