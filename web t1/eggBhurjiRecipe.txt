Heat Oil: Heat oil or ghee in a pan or skillet over medium heat.

Tempering: Add cumin seeds to the hot oil and let them splutter.

Sauté Aromatics: Add chopped onions, green chilies, ginger, and garlic to the pan. Sauté until onions turn golden brown and the raw smell of garlic disappears.

Add Tomatoes: Add chopped tomatoes to the pan. Cook until tomatoes are soft and oil starts to separate from the mixture.

Spices: Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala powder, and salt to taste. Mix well and cook for another minute to let the spices blend with the mixture.

Scramble Eggs: Break the eggs directly into the pan. Use a spatula or a spoon to scramble the eggs and mix them well with the onion-tomato mixture. Cook on medium heat, stirring continuously, until the eggs are cooked through and there is no liquid left.

Garnish: Garnish with chopped fresh coriander leaves.

Serve: Serve hot with roti, naan, paratha, or bread of your choice. It can also be enjoyed with rice.
