Prepare Fillings: If you're adding any fillings like vegetables or cheese, chop them into small pieces and set them aside.

Beat Eggs: Crack the eggs into a bowl. Add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste. Optionally, add a tablespoon or two of milk to make the omelette fluffier. Whisk the eggs until the yolks and whites are well combined and slightly frothy.

Heat Pan: Place a non-stick skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Add butter or oil and let it melt and coat the pan evenly.

Cooking the Omelette:

Pour the beaten eggs into the heated skillet.
As the eggs start to set around the edges, use a spatula to gently push the cooked parts toward the center of the pan.
Tilt the pan to let the uncooked egg mixture flow to the edges.
Continue cooking until the omelette is mostly set but still slightly runny on top.
Add Fillings: Once the omelette is mostly cooked but still slightly runny on top, sprinkle your desired fillings evenly over one half of the omelette.

Fold and Serve: Carefully fold the omelette in half with a spatula. Let it cook for another 1-2 minutes until the fillings are heated through and any cheese is melted.

Serve: Slide the omelette onto a plate and serve hot. You can garnish with herbs or additional toppings if desired.

Enjoy your homemade egg omelette!
