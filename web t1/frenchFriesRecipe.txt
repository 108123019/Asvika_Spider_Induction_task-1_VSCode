Prepare Potatoes:

Peel the potatoes (if desired) or scrub them well under running water to remove any dirt. Pat them dry with a kitchen towel.
Cut Potatoes:

Cut the potatoes into evenly sized sticks, about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. You can cut them thinner for crispier fries or thicker for softer fries. Try to make them as uniform as possible for even cooking.
Soak Potatoes (Optional Step for Crispy Fries):

Place the cut potatoes in a large bowl of cold water. Let them soak for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours. This helps remove excess starch and makes the fries crispier.
Dry Potatoes:

Drain the potatoes from the water and pat them dry thoroughly with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels. Removing excess moisture is key to achieving crispy fries.
Preheat Oil:

Heat oil in a deep fryer or a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. The ideal frying temperature is around 350-375°F (175-190°C).
Fry Potatoes:

Carefully add a handful of dried potatoes to the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry in batches if necessary.
Fry the potatoes for about 5-7 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crispy. Stir occasionally to ensure even cooking.
Use a slotted spoon or a spider strainer to remove the fries from the oil and transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.
Sprinkle immediately with salt while they are still hot.
Repeat:

Repeat the frying process with the remaining batches of potatoes until all are cooked.
Serve:

Serve the French fries hot and crispy. You can enjoy them plain or with ketchup, mayonnaise, or any dipping sauce of your choice.
