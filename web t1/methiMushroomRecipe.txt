Heat oil or ghee in a pan or kadai (wok).
Add the whole spices – black cardamom, cinnamon, green cardamoms, cloves, tej patta and mace.

Fry the spices till the oil becomes fragrant and the spices splutter. Don't burn them. Fry spices on a low heat.

Add onions and stirring often sauté them on low to medium-low heat till they begin to get golden.
Be patient as onions do take time to get browned. Keep stirring the onions in between.

Once the onions begin to get golden brown, add chopped green chilies and ginger-garlic paste. Sauté for a minute on low heat.
Now add the tomatoes. Sauté them on low to medium-low heat till they become soft and mushy. Keep on stirring the masala base.
Add all the dry spice powders – turmeric, coriander and red chili powder. Mix well. 

Then sauté stirring often till oil leaves from the sides of the whole masala mixture.
Lower the heat and add the marinated mushrooms.
Also add the chopped methi leaves or dry methi leaves (kasuri methi). Mix again. 

Add about ¼ to ½ cup of water. Also add salt as per taste. Do keep in mind that some salt has been added to the marination. 
Stir, cover the pan or kadai and simmer for about 8 to 10 minutes on low heat till the mushrooms are tender and cooked.

Do check in between and if the consistency looks dry then add some more water.
Once the mushrooms are cooked and the curry has a medium consistency then check the taste and add salt if required. 

Garnish methi mushroom with some chopped coriander leaves.
Serve methi mushroom hot or warm with roti or naan.
