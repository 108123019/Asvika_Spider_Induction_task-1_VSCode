Heat oil in a pan and add the following whole spices – cumin seeds, tejpatta, cinnamon, black cardamom, green cardamoms, cloves and a single strand of mace.
Fry the spices for a few seconds until they become aromatic and splutter.

Lower the heat and add the ground onion-ginger-garlic paste.
Mix the paste with the oil. If the paste splutters then cover the pan with a lid allowing for some space for the steam to pass.

On a low to medium heat stirring often continue to sauté until the onion paste starts thickening.
Stir and sauté until the paste becomes golden. This sautéing of onion paste takes some time. So to quicken the process add a pinch of salt.

Now add the tomato puree. Stir. Then add the spice powders – turmeric powder, red chilli powder and coriander powder.
Mix well and sauté until you see oil releasing from the sides of the masala.

Add the beaten curd (yogurt). As soon as you add yogurt, mix thoroughly and quickly.

Simmer on a low to medium flame for 2 to 3 minutes.
Then add water.
Season with salt. Mix very well.
Cover the pan with a lid. On a low to medium heat simmer the mushroom masala for 18 to 20 minutes or until the mushrooms are tender.
