To start with, heat a pan with oil, 1 teaspoon butter. Add garlic, ginger and green chillies.

Tip in cubed onion and give it a fry. Add cashews and saute until onion turn translucent.
Remove in a plate for cooling.
Meanwhile, keep paneer cubes in hot water until use.

Grind it along with cubed tomatoes to a smooth paste.
Heat oil and temper with Cardamom, cinnamon and cloves.
Add the ground onion tomato paste and give it a stir.

Tip in red chilli powder, coriander powder, turmeric, kasoori methi and mix well.
Continue frying the masala for  4-5 minutes in medium flame or until the raw smell goes off.

The onion tomato mixture should be thick, shiny and ooze oil. Add oil in between if needed.
After that, pour milk little at a time in low flame and stir well to mix. Repeat again until you add all the milk.

Adjust water (I added Â¼ cup) and sprinkle required salt. Mix well.

Once it start to bubble again, add paneer drained from water.
Mix well and in goes the cooking cream.

Keep the flame in low and don't let the gravy boil vigorously. Just mix in low flame for 2 minutes and switch off the flame.

Garnish with 3 tablespoon of coriander leaves. Top it with remaining butter.
